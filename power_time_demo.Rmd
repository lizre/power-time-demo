## TLDR: Use high-traffic surfaces and high baseline metrics 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE, # don't print the code when knitted to markdown
  fig.width = 8,
  fig.height = 6,
  fig.retina = 4
  ) 
library(here)
here::here()

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(pwr)

pretty_kable <- purrr::partial(knitr::kable, format.args = list(big.mark = ","))

# this function tells you the required N
gen_power_n <- function(base.effect, expected.lift) {
  new.effect <- base.effect * (1 + expected.lift)
  effect.size <- ES.h(base.effect, new.effect)
  power_analysis <- pwr.2p.test( # 2-proportion power analysis function
    h = effect.size,
    n = NULL, # sample size, NULL because we want to compute this
    sig.level = 0.05, 
    power = 0.8, 
    alternative = "two.sided" # 2-sided test
  )
  power_analysis$n * 3
  # the rest of the function tells you how many people you need per group. here, because we have two groups, multiply by 2 to get total N needed.
}

```

### Scenario 0: I hope you're patient 📅 

📈 Baseline: 5%
<br>🚎 Traffic: 1500 viewers per day

```{r}
# calculate the base effect
base.effect <- .05
enrollment.percents <- c(1)
expected.lifts <- c(0.025, 0.05, .1)
pwr.options <- expand.grid(list("enrollment.percent" = enrollment.percents, 
                                "expected.lift" = expected.lifts))

daily.viewers <- 1500

tibble(pwr.options,
    daily.viewers) %>% 
      rowwise() %>% 
        mutate(users.needed = ceiling(gen_power_n(base.effect, 
                                            expected.lift))) %>% 
          ungroup() %>% 
            mutate(daily.enrolled = round(enrollment.percents * daily.viewers),
                   num.days = ceiling(users.needed / daily.enrolled)) %>% 
  mutate(across(c(expected.lift, 
                  enrollment.percent),
                function(x) str_c(100*x,"%"))) %>% 
  select(`Expected Change` = expected.lift,
    `Users Needed` = users.needed,
    `Enrollment Percent` = enrollment.percent,
    `Daily Trials Enrolled` = daily.enrolled,
    `Days to Insight` = num.days) %>% pretty_kable()

```


### Happy scenario #1: Choose a metric with a higher baseline 📈

📈 Baseline: 30%
<br>🚎 Traffic: 1500 viewers per day

```{r}
# calculate the base effect
base.effect <- .30
enrollment.percents <- c(1)
expected.lifts <- c(0.025, 0.05, .1)
pwr.options <- expand.grid(list("enrollment.percent" = enrollment.percents, 
                                "expected.lift" = expected.lifts))

daily.viewers <- 1500

tibble(pwr.options,
    daily.viewers) %>% 
      rowwise() %>% 
        mutate(users.needed = ceiling(gen_power_n(base.effect, 
                                            expected.lift))) %>% 
          ungroup() %>% 
            mutate(daily.enrolled = round(enrollment.percents * daily.viewers),
                   num.days = ceiling(users.needed / daily.enrolled)) %>% 
  mutate(across(c(expected.lift, 
                  enrollment.percent),
                function(x) str_c(100*x,"%"))) %>% 
  select(`Expected Change` = expected.lift,
    `Users Needed` = users.needed,
    `Enrollment Percent` = enrollment.percent,
    `Daily Trials Enrolled` = daily.enrolled,
    `Days to Insight` = num.days) %>% pretty_kable()

```


### Happy scenario #2: Choose a surface with higher traffic 🚎🚕🚚 

📈 Baseline: 5%
<br>🚎 Traffic: 7500 viewers per day

```{r}
# calculate the base effect
base.effect <- .05
enrollment.percents <- c(1)
expected.lifts <- c(0.025, 0.05, .1)
pwr.options <- expand.grid(list("enrollment.percent" = enrollment.percents, 
                                "expected.lift" = expected.lifts))

daily.viewers <- 7500

tibble(pwr.options,
    daily.viewers) %>% 
      rowwise() %>% 
        mutate(users.needed = ceiling(gen_power_n(base.effect, 
                                            expected.lift))) %>% 
          ungroup() %>% 
            mutate(daily.enrolled = round(enrollment.percents * daily.viewers),
                   num.days = ceiling(users.needed / daily.enrolled)) %>% 
  mutate(across(c(expected.lift, 
                  enrollment.percent),
                function(x) str_c(100*x,"%"))) %>% 
  select(`Expected Change` = expected.lift,
    `Users Needed` = users.needed,
    `Enrollment Percent` = enrollment.percent,
    `Daily Trials Enrolled` = daily.enrolled,
    `Days to Insight` = num.days) %>% pretty_kable()

```
